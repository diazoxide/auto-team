# Project Instructions for Claude

## Commit Message Guidelines
- NEVER add Claude branding in commit messages
- NEVER include "Generated with Claude Code" signatures
- NEVER include "Co-Authored-By: Claude" lines
- Keep commit messages simple and professional
- Focus on the actual changes made

## Development Workflow
- Run `make check` before committing to ensure code passes all checks
- Use `make fmt` to format Go code properly
- All tests should pass before creating commits
